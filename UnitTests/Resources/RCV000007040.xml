(2000) showed that 2 common cosegregating missense mutations (asp299 to gly and thr399 to ile, 603030.0002) that affect the extracellular domain of the TLR4 receptor are associated with blunted response to inhaled lipopolysaccharide in humans. In transfection experiments, they found that the asp299-to-gly (D299G) mutation, but not the thr399-to-ile (T399I) mutation, interrupted TLR4-mediated LPS signaling. An A-to-G transition at nucleotide 896 of the TLR4 gene was responsible for the D299G amino acid change. Allele frequency of the 896G substitution was 6.6% in a population studied for airway responsiveness and 7.9% in a control population from Iowa. These findings indicated that the 2 populations were in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium as to distribution of the TLR4 mutation. Findings demonstrated that the 896G substitution altered the ability of the host to respond to environmental stress; however, not all of the subjects who were hyporesponsive to LPS had mutations in TLR4, and not everyone with the TLR4 mutation was hyporesponsive to inhaled LPS.</Attribute><Citation Type="general"><ID Source="PubMed">10835634</ID></Citation></ObservedData><ObservedData ID="11315586"><Attribute Type="Description">In a study in Bruneck, Italy, Kiechl et al.

The frequencies of heterozygous and homozygous germline D299G polymorphism (rs4986790) were 17.1% and 0.7%, respectively. Carriers of the polymorphism did not differ with respect to any classical prognostic factors from noncarriers. The frequency of metastasis by 5 years after surgery was statistically higher in the group carrying the D299G polymorphism (40% vs 26.5%). The Kaplan-Meier estimate of metastasis-free survival showed an overall significantly lower percentage of metastasis-free patients in the group of D299G carriers. Apetoh et al. (2007) found that the D299G SNP reduces the interaction between TLR4 and HMGB1 (163905) and abolishes the capacity of monocyte-derived dendritic cells to crosspresent dying melanoma cells to Mart1 (605513)-specific HLA-A2 (see 142800)-restricted cytotoxic T lymphocytes, a biologic property that depends on HMGB1 in wildtype monocyte-derived dendritic cells. Based on these and other findings, Apetoh et al. (2007) concluded that the D299G polymorphism in TLR4 may influence the immunologic component of anthracycline-based chemotherapy in human cancer. The authors stated that the D299G variant is found in 8 to 10% of Caucasians.</Attribute><Citation Type="general"><ID Source="PubMed">17704786</ID></Citation></ObservedData><ObservedData ID="11315586"><Attribute Type="Description">---Myocardial Infarction</Attribute></ObservedData><ObservedData ID="11315586"><Attribute Type="Description">In Sicily, Balistreri et al.
